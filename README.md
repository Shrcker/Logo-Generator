<h1 id='description'>Vector-Based Logo Generator <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"><img alt="The MIT License" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg" /></a></h1><br />A simple node.js application that generates a vector logo as an .svg file from user input. It operates off of any version of node and involves Inquirer user prompts and Jest tests.<br />The program is designed for small companies to use as a mockup generator, allowing them to quickly put together a brand identity without too much hassle. I do advise that you edit the generated file in any .svg editing program like Adobe Illustrator in order to get the most out of it.<br /><strong>Link:</strong> <a href=https://https://github.com/Shrcker/Logo-Generator>Github Link</a><br />
